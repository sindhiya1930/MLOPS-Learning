Analytics- insights from large live and automated
Data Driven Decision Making - decision made from data
As Devops Engineer - Deployments emit data(Server,Coumpite,Storage)
ELK,Splunk,DataRobot,DataDog(platfomrs+AI)
DORA metrics
- Deployment Frequency: How often code is deployed to production. 
- Lead Time for Changes: The time it takes for a commit to reach production. 
- Change Failure Rate: The percentage of deployments that cause failures in production. 
- Mean Time to Restore (MTTR): The average time it takes to recover from a service outage. (SLI,SLO,SLA)
  Indicator - Tracking event
  Objective - end goal
  Agreement -

- Diagnostic(when errormoccur)
- Predictive(prediction)
- Prescriptive(what need to be done for outages)
